# Traffic-Sign-Classification-using-deep-learning

You must have heard about the self-driving cars in which the passenger can fully depend on the car for traveling. 
But to achieve level 5 autonomous, it is necessary for vehicles to understand and follow all traffic rules.

There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc.
Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.
In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. 
With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
